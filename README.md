# EXIF Scripts
Scripts making use of [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) to work with EXIF metadata in images.

## External dependencies
By nature, these script rely on [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/)
being installed and functional.

The annotation utilizes [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick)
(which on a Mac also seems to require [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) to be installed)
